This chapter guides the reader in creating an application that shows online pictures that were taken near the device’s current location. It covers location services, web API calls and Photo Gallery integration.

###Topics covered:
- Getting device’s coordinates
- Retrieving photos based on nearby locations
- Displaying the pictures
- Saving the desired pictures to the Image Gallery

By the end of this chapter, readers will have an application that allows them to view different pictures based on their location. Also, if they like a picture, they can also save this picture to the device’s Photo Gallery.

###Flickr API
All images retrieved by the application come from the Flickr API. All the detailed information regarding each function is contained in their [developer website](http://www.flickr.com/services/api/).
